In its latest Sustainability Report published on Wednesday, QP said its goals include `` reducing the emissions intensity of Qatar's LNG facilities by 25% and of its upstream facilities by at least 15%. '' The company is also aiming to reduce gas flaring intensity across its upstream facilities by more than 75% and has raised its carbon capture and storage ambitions from 5 million tons/yr to 7 million tons/yr by 2027. About 2.2 million tons/yr of the carbon capture goal will come from the 32 million ton/yr Phase 1 of the LNG expansion, also known as the North Field East project. A further 1.1 million tons/yr will come from Phase 2, known as the North Field South project, which will raise Qatar's LNG capacity by a further 16 million tons/yr. Qatar currently has an LNG production capacity of around 78 million tons/yr and is eyeing a phased expansion to 126 million tons/yr. QP says it should be able to eliminate routine gas flaring by 2030, with methane emissions limited `` by setting a methane intensity target of 0.2% across all facilities by 2025. '' The company also plans to build some 1.6 gigawatts of solar energy capacity by 2025, half of which should come from the Siraj solar power project next year ( EIF Jan.22'20). Until this month, there had been little news about Phase 2 of Qatar's massive LNG expansion. But McDermott International said last week that it had been awarded the front-end engineering and design contract for five offshore wellhead platforms ( LNGI Jan.12'21). Bids for construction of all four trains for Phase 1 of the LNG expansion were submitted in September ( LNGI Sep.15'20). But QP judged them to be too expensive and none met its targeted 50-week construction schedule. Shortlisted contractors were asked to look for cost savings and submit new bids. The contract, which consultancy Rystad estimates to be worth around $ 35 billion, is expected to be awarded by Mar. 31. Shortly after the construction contract is awarded, QP is expected to select foreign investments partners to take stakes of up to 30% in the Phase 1 trains. Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Total, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Eni have been shortlisted. QP has repeatedly said that it is prepared to proceed without international investment partners if it determines that the offers it receives are not sufficiently attractive. But the shortlisted companies are expected to bid aggressively for what is expected to be the world's lowest-cost and most environmentally friendly LNG ( LNGI Nov.9'20).
